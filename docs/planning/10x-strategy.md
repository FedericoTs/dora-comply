# 10X Strategic Analysis: DORA-TPRM Platform

**Document Status:** [CURRENT]
**Last Updated:** 2024-12-28
**Framework:** Tech-Entrepreneur 10X Thinking

## First Principles Analysis

### What Do We Know To Be Absolutely True?

1. **DORA is mandatory** - 22,000+ EU financial entities must comply by January 2026
2. **RoI submission is non-negotiable** - First deadline: April 30, 2026
3. **Third-party risk is exploding** - 35.5% of breaches originate from vendors
4. **Manual processes don't scale** - Most teams have 1-2 TPRM employees managing 1,000+ vendors
5. **AI can parse documents** - LLMs can extract structured data from unstructured documents
6. **Vendors hate questionnaires** - Response fatigue is real (60+ day average response times)
7. **Existing tools were built for US market** - DORA is an afterthought

### What Are We Assuming Because "That's How It's Always Been Done"?

| Assumption | Challenge | 10X Alternative |
|------------|-----------|-----------------|
| "Vendor assessments require questionnaires" | Manual, slow, vendor fatigue | AI-parse existing documents (SOC 2, ISO) |
| "RoI is a compliance exercise" | Seen as checkbox, updated quarterly | Living document, real-time intelligence |
| "TPRM requires dedicated team" | Resource-intensive, doesn't scale | AI handles 90% of work |
| "Vendor risk is assessed annually" | Point-in-time, misses changes | Continuous monitoring, event-driven |
| "Implementation takes months" | Long sales cycles, slow time-to-value | 10-day deployment target |

## The 10X Vision Statement

> **"Transform DORA compliance from a months-long manual burden into a minutes-long AI-powered workflow. Every EU financial entity deserves enterprise-grade vendor risk management without enterprise-grade complexity or cost."**

---

## Key Insight

The biggest 10X opportunity isn't just automation—it's **eliminating the questionnaire entirely** for vendors that have already been audited. If a vendor has a SOC 2 Type II report, we should be able to extract 90% of what we need without asking them a single question. This is the insight competitors are missing.
