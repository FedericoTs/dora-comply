## Context

We needed to decide whether to offer a free tier for small entities with limited vendors (<10) to drive adoption and create a growth flywheel.

## Decision

**We will NOT offer a free tier.**

The platform will launch with paid-only tiers:
- Pro tier: For mid-market financial entities
- Enterprise tier: For large institutions with advanced needs

## Rationale

1. **Regulatory urgency**: DORA deadline creates natural demand; no need to subsidize adoption
2. **Qualified leads**: Paid-only ensures serious buyers, not tire-kickers
3. **Resource focus**: No support burden from non-paying users
4. **Positioning**: Premium positioning aligned with compliance-critical use case
5. **Unit economics**: Avoid infrastructure costs without revenue

## Consequences

### Positive
- Faster path to revenue
- Higher quality customer base
- Simpler infrastructure (no usage limits enforcement)

### Negative
- Slower initial adoption curve
- No viral/PLG growth loop
- Competitors with free tiers may capture SMB segment

## Alternatives Considered

- **Freemium**: Rejected due to support costs and positioning concerns
- **Free trial (14-30 days)**: Still viable and recommended for conversion
